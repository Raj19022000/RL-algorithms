Function approximators like neural networks have succesfully been combined with reinforcement learning because of their ability to derive optimal estimations of the environment using higher order inputs like audios and images. This is an implementation of the Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning (![](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf)) with some crunch time tweaks.
